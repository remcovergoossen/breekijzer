clicking serverpatchingpreSW : Donderdag in Set compliancy chart should show compliancytable info only on that ID
clicking the Success or Inprogress bar in the deployment compliancy chart should show only that Deployment AND filter on Success / Inprogress

Server compliancy table should have a filter list or all possible options from SCCMState / LocalState columns
