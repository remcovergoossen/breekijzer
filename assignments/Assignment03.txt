Add /services and /pools endpoint from API to AppPoolsChecklist / ServicesChecklist
Both endpoints have these columns:
    "name": 
    "state": 
    "Device": 

For all tables there is an action column with a computer icon, when the button is clicked the URL from /vmrc endpoint for that device should be opened.

For example, in the application pools there is a device called S0ACAW0062O, when shown in the list, the button should open the vmrc link that can be found under the vmrc endpoint:

http://localhost:3000/vmrc?device=S0ACAW0062O
